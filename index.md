**BigBlueButton** is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.  We believe every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience.  We intend to make that possible with BigBlueButton.

This documentation is for administrators and developers who want to install, customize, and enhance BigBlueButton. For an end-user overview of BigBlueButton (with videos) visit [bigbluebutton.org](http://bigbluebutton.org). 

The source code for BigBlueButton is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).

## Getting started

BigBlueButton enables real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and desktop.  Users join a BigBlueButton session either as a viewer (share webcam, audio, and chat), or as a a moderator.  A moderator can mute/unmute other viewers, lock down viewers, or make anyone (including themselves) the presenter.  
If you are new to BigBlueButton, we recommend the following (in order):

  1. Watch the [overview videos](http://bigbluebutton.org/videos) to understand the capabilities of a moderator/presenter and viewer.
  1. Try out BigBlueButton using our [Demo Server](http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/).
  1. Join the BigBlueButton community

Next, depending on whether you are a developer or administrator, we recommend:

  1. [Install](/install/install.html) BigBlueButton your server (Ubuntu 14.04 64-bit).
  1. [Integrate](http://bigbluebutton.org/open-source-integrations/) it or use the [API](/dev/api.html) to create/customize an integration with your system.
  1. [Setup](/dev/setup.html) a development environment to modify and extend BigBlueButton itself.

If your an educational or commercial institution using (or building upon) BigBlueButton, we encourage you to spread the word (blog, tweet, upload a video to YouTube, etc.) about the project.  With the help of our community, BigBlueButton is [localized](/dev/localization.html) into over 35 languages and used to help teach students around the world.
