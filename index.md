**BigBlueButton** is an open source web conferencing system for online learning.  

We believe every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality online learning experience.  

This documentation for administrators and developers who want to setup and customize their own BigBlueButton server. If you are an end-user (instructor or teacher) interested in learning more about BigBlueButton (and how it works) visit [bigbluebutton.org](http://bigbluebutton.org). 

The source code for BigBlueButton is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).

## Overview

BigBlueButton enables real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard), polling, emote icons (including raise hand), chat, and the presenter's desktop.  It is [localized](/dev/localization.html) into over 35 languages and supports JAWS screen reader for students with visual disabilities. 

Users join a BigBlueButton session as one of two roles: _viewer_ or _moderator_.  A viewer (typically the student) can chat, display an emote icon, send/receive audio and video, and respond to polls.  A moderator (typically the instructor) can -- in addition to all the capabilities of a viewer -- mute/unmute other viewers, lock down viewers, or make anyone (including themselves) the presenter.  The current presenter can can upload slides, annotate them (using the whiteboard controls), and share his or her desktop for all to see.
