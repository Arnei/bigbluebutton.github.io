**BigBlueButton** is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.  

We believe every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience.  We intend to make that possible with BigBlueButton.

We created this documentation for administrators and developers who want to install, customize, and enhance BigBlueButton. For an end-user overview of BigBlueButton (with videos) visit [bigbluebutton.org](http://bigbluebutton.org). 

The source code for BigBlueButton is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).
