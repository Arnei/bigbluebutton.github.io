**BigBlueButton** is an open source web conferencing system for online learning.  

We believe every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality online learning experience.  

We've written this documentation for administrators and developers who want to setup and customize their own BigBlueButton server. If you are an end-user (instructor or teacher) interested in learning more about BigBlueButton (and how it works) visit [bigbluebutton.org](http://bigbluebutton.org). 

The source code for BigBlueButton is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).

## Getting started

BigBlueButton enables real-time sharing of audio, video, slides (with whiteboard), polling, emote icons (including raise hand), chat, and the presenter's desktop.  It is [localized](/dev/localization.html) into over 35 languages and supports JAWS screen reader for students with visual disabilities. 

Users join a BigBlueButton session as one of two roles: _viewer_ or _moderator_.  A viewer (typically the student) can chat, display an emote icon, send/receive audio and video, and respond to polls.  A moderator (typically the instructor) can -- in addition to all the capabilities of a viewer -- mute/unmute other viewers, lock down viewers, or make anyone (including themselves) the presenter.  The current presenter can can upload slides, annotate them (using the whiteboard controls), and share his or her desktop for all to see.


If you are new to BigBlueButton we recommend (in order): 

  1. Watch the [overview videos](http://bigbluebutton.org/videos) to better understand the capabilities of viewer, moderator, and presenter.
  1. Try out BigBlueButton using our [Demo Server](http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/). 
  1. Join the [BigBlueButton community](https://bigbluebutton.org/support/community/).
  1. Follow the project on social media: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bigbluebutton), [FaceBook](https://www.facebook.com/bigbluebutton), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/bigbluebuttonshare), or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+bigbluebutton).  
      
Next, depending on whether you are a developer or administrator, we recommend:

  1. [Install](/install/install.html) BigBlueButton your own server (Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit).
  1. Setup the [GreenLight](/install/green-light.html) front end, or use an existing [integration](http://bigbluebutton.org/open-source-integrations/) (such as Moodle or WordPress).
  1. Read the [FAQ](/support/faq.html).

If you are a developer, we recommend
  1. [Setup](/dev/setup.html) a development environment to modify and extend BigBlueButton for your needs.
  1. Integrate BigBlueButton with your applicaiton using the [BigBlueButton API](/dev/api.html).

The BigBlueButton project began in 2008. The project is managed by a core group of [committers](/support/faq.html#bigbluebutton-committer) that are _very_ determined to see this project meet is goals.  If you like BigBlueButton, help us by spreading the word (blog, tweet, upload a video to YouTube, etc.) about the project.  And definitely join one of the [mailing lists](https://bigbluebutton.org/support/community/) -- you'll an active and a global community supporting BigBlueButton for the entrepreneurial opportunities and social benefits of providing supported and tested platform for online learning.


## Latest versions
