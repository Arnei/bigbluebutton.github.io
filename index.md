**BigBlueButton** is an open source web conferencing system for on-line learning.  We believe every student with a web browser should have access to a high-quality on-line learning experience.  We intend to make that possible with BigBlueButton.

This documentation is for administrators and developers who want to install, customize, and enhance BigBlueButton. For an end-user overview of BigBlueButton (with videos) visit [bigbluebutton.org](http://bigbluebutton.org). 

The source code for BigBlueButton is hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).

## Getting started

BigBlueButton enables real-time sharing of audio, video, slides, chat, and presneter's desktop.  Users join a BigBlueButton session either as a viewer or moderator.  A viewer can chat and send/receive audio and video.  A moderator can mute/unmute other viewers, lock down viewers, or make anyone (including themselves) the presenter.  A user who is the current presenter can upload slides and annotate them for all to see.

If you are new to BigBlueButton, to get started we recommend (in order): 

  1. Watch the [overview videos](http://bigbluebutton.org/videos) to understand the capabilities of a moderator/presenter and viewer.
