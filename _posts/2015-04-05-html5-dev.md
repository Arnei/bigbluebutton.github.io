# HTML5 Development Environment Setup

**Note**: These instructions are DRAFT and currently under construction.

### BigBlueButton HTML5 Client Design
If you have not already done so, you should read through an [Overview of HTML5 Client](/html/html5-overview.html)

### Initial setup

Before you begin, you will need to have a BigBlueButton 0.9.0 server installed from packages (see [install BigBlueButton](/install/install.html)).


### Installation

You will need to install [Meteor.js](http://www.meteor.com).
```curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh```

In case you do not have curl installed, run
```sudo apt-get install curl```
before the above command



You want to clone BigBlueButton’s repository locally.
Note that currently all the code for the HTML5 client is available on BigBlueButton's master branch. You can clone the entire repository or just the master branch:
```
git clone -b master --single-branch git@github.com:bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton.git
```

You want to modify /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties so that PNG images for the HTML5 client's presentation are generated by default.
```
vi /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties
```
Set the field ‘pngImagesRequired’ to true. Then restart tomcat7.
```sudo service tomcat7 restart```

You will need to create an nginx rule:
```sudo vi /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/html5client.nginx```
Copy-paste the following:
```
location /html5client {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
}

location /_timesync {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
}
```
Save the file. Reload:
```sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload```



### Running
Assuming that you cloned the repository in ```/home/firstuser/dev```, navigate to
```cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html5/app```  
In order to run the server side of the HTML5 client you will need to execute the following:
```./start.sh```

Note that you may need to edit ```start.sh``` to remove ```HOME=/usr/share/meteor``` depending on where you installed meteor.
Once you run ```./start.sh``` wait a few seconds and confirm that the configuration is valid by navigating to ```http://<your_ip>/html5client/check```
The result should be ```{"html5clientStatus":"running"}```

### Usage
Go to ```http://<your_ip>/``` in the browser. Select “API examples”. Navigate to “HTML5 Client Demo” and use the form. You will enter a meeting titled “Demo Meeting”.

On a mobile device (Android) you can simply attempt to join a meeting from ```http://<your_ip>/```. Since your device's browser lacks Flash by default, you will be offered to navigate to the HTML5 client instead.

####What is implemented?
  * two way public and private chat
  * viewing presentation with slides, cursor, anotations
  * audio using WebRTC
