# HTML5 Development Environment Setup

## BigBlueButton HTML5 Client Design
If you have not already done so, you should read through the [Overview of HTML5 Client](/html/html5-overview.html)

## Initial setup

Before you begin, you will need to have a BigBlueButton 0.9.0 server installed from packages (see [install BigBlueButton](/install/install.html)).


### Have a GitHub Account

The BigBlueButton [source is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).  You need a GitHub account.  Also, you need to be very familiar with how git works.  Specifically, you need to know how to

  * clone a repository
  * create a branch
  * push changes back to a repository

If you have not used git before, or if the terms **_clone_**, **_branch_**, and **_commit_** are unfamiliar to you, stop now.  These are fundamental concepts to git that you need to become competent with before trying to develop on BigBlueButton. To become competent, a good place to start is this [free book](http://progit.org/book/) and [GitHub Help pages](http://help.github.com/).

Using GitHub makes it easy for you to work on your own copy of the BigBlueButton source, store your updates to the source to your GitHub account, and make it easy for you to [contribute to BigBlueButton](/support/faq.html#contributing-to-bigbluebutton).

### Subscribe to bigbluebutton-dev

We recommend you subscribe to the [bigbluebutton-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2) mailing list to follow updates to the development of BigBlueButton and to collaborate with other developers.



### Checking out the Source

We want to clone the source in the following directory:

```
/home/firstuser/dev
```

Using your GitHub account, do the following

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the BigBlueButton repository into your GitHub account.
2. Clone your repository into your `~/dev` folder.

Note that you need just the master branch.

```
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/bigbluebutton.git
```

After cloning, you'll have the following directory (make sure the `bigbluebutton` directory is within your `dev` directory).

```
/home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton
```

Confirm that you are working on the master branch.

```
cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton
git status
```

You should see

```
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

When you first clone the BigBlueButton git repository, git will place you, by default, on the `master` branch, which is the latest code for BigBlueButton.



## Installation of the HTML5 client component
### curl

You will need to download some files throughout these instructions using curl. If it is not installed on your server, you can install the package using the following command

```
$ sudo apt-get install curl
```

###Meteor.js

You will need to install [Meteor.js](http://www.meteor.com).

```
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

###Configurations
You want to modify `bigbluebutton.properties` so that PNG images for the HTML5 client's presentation are generated by default.

```
$ sudo vi /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties
```

Set the field `pngImagesRequired` to true. Then restart tomcat7.

```$ sudo service tomcat7 restart```

You will need to create an nginx rule:

```$ sudo vi /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/html5client.nginx```


Copy-paste the following:

```
location /html5client {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
}

location /_timesync {
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
}
```
Save the file. Reload:

```$ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx reload```

Test the nginx configuration

```
sudo nginx -t
```
If the output from the above command contains errors check again the nginx configuration you just edited.


### Running
Assuming that you cloned the repository in ```/home/firstuser/dev```, navigate to

```$ cd /home/firstuser/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html5/app```  

In order to run the server side of the HTML5 client you will need to execute the following:

``` $ ./start.sh ```

Note that you may need to first edit the script ```start.sh``` to remove ```HOME=/usr/share/meteor``` depending on where you installed meteor.
Once you run

```$ ./start.sh```

Wait until the process starts and confirm that the configuration is valid by navigating to

```
http://<your_ip>/html5client/check
```

The result should be ```{"html5clientStatus":"running"}```

### Usage
Go to ```http://<your_ip>/``` in the browser. Select “API examples”. Navigate to “HTML5 Client Demo” and use the form. You will enter a meeting titled “Demo Meeting”.

On a mobile device (Android) you can simply attempt to join a meeting from ```http://<your_ip>/```. Since your device's browser lacks Flash by default, you will be offered to navigate to the HTML5 client instead.


####What is implemented?
  * two way public and private chat
  * viewing presentation with slides, cursor, anotations
  * audio using WebRTC
