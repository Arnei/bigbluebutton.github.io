# Installing BigBlueButton 2.0-beta

These instructions cover the steps to install BigBlueButton 2.0-beta (referred hereafter as BigBlueButton 2.0).

See [What's new in BigBlueButton 2.0](/2.0/20overview.html).

If you encounter any issues during installation/upgrade, please post to our [bigbluebutton-setup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-setup) mailing list with a description of the issue you encountered.


## New install

The architecture and packages of BigBlueButton 2.0 and 1.1 are identical. 

To install BigBlueButton 2.0, follow the steps in [BigBlueButton 1.1 Install Guide](/install/install.html) with one difference: when you reach [Step 2. Install apt-get key for BigBlueButton repositoryAnchor](/install/install.html#install-apt-get-key-for-bigbluebutton-repository), change the command from

~~~
$ echo "deb http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-110/ bigbluebutton-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
~~~

to

~~~
$ echo "deb http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-200/ bigbluebutton-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
~~~

Notice the repository URL has changed from `xenial-110` to `xenial-200`.

That's it.  Proceed through the rest of the installation steps and you'll have a BigBlueButton 2.0 running at the end.  

After the install, you can see that most of the packages are now 2.0 by running `dpkg -l | grep bbb`.  Here's a sample output on one of our test servers (your versions may be slightly ahead).

## Upgrade to latest build of BigBlueButtton 2.0

To upgrade from a server running BigBlueButton 1.1 or upgrade to latest build of BigBlueButton 2.0, login to the server via SSH and edit the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list`.  Change the contents to

~~~
deb http://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-200/ bigbluebutton-xenial main
~~~

Notice the repository URL has changed from `xenial-110` to `xenial-200`.  You need only do the above step once on a server.

Next, execute the following commands, changing `IP_or_hostname` to the IP address or hostname of your BigBlueButton 1.1/2.0 server.

~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get autoremove

sudo bbb-conf --setip <IP_or_hostname>
sudo bbb-conf --check
~~~

You need to do the `sudo bbb-conf --setip <IP_or_hostname>` each time after upgrade to the latests build of BigBlueButton 2.9-beta to ensure that all configuration files have the correct IP/hostname.
