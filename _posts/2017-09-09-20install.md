# BigBlueButton Installation Script

The `bbb-install` script automates the [steps to install](/2.0/20install.html) BigBlueButton 2.0-beta (referred hereafter as BigBlueButton 2.0) on a Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit server with a single public IP address.

Why the requirement of the server having a single public IP address?  If you intend to install BigBlueButton 2.0 on a server behind a firewall, then there are additional steps (which are covered in detail in the [install documentation](/2.0/20install.html), that are beyond the scope of an installation script.  

Still, many hosting providers -- both baremetal and virtual -- give you servers with a single public IP address.  In these cases, you can use `bbb-install` to setup a new BigBlueButton server in a few minutes.

See [What's new in BigBlueButton 2.0](/2.0/20overview.html).

If you encounter any issues during installation/upgrade, please post to our [bigbluebutton-setup](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/bigbluebutton-setup) mailing list with a description of the issue you encountered.

You have two options for installing BigBlueButton 2.0:

  * Step-by-step install
  * Install via script (if you server has a single IP address and is not behind NAT)

## Step-by-step Install

To install BigBlueButton 2.0, follow the steps in [BigBlueButton 1.1 Install Guide](/install/install.html) with _one_ difference: when you reach [Step 2. Install apt-get key for BigBlueButton repositoryAnchor](/install/install.html#install-apt-get-key-for-bigbluebutton-repository), change the command from

~~~
echo "deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-110/ bigbluebutton-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
~~~

to

~~~
echo "deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-200/ bigbluebutton-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list
~~~

Notice the repository URL has changed from `xenial-110` to `xenial-200`.

That's it.  Proceed through the rest of the installation steps and you'll have a BigBlueButton 2.0 running at the end.  

After the install, you can see that most of the packages are now 2.0 by running `dpkg -l | grep bbb`.  Here's a sample output on one of our test servers (your versions may be slightly ahead).

### Upgrade from BigBlueButtton 1.1 to 2.0

To upgrade your BigBlueButton server from 1.1 to 2.0, login to the server via SSH and edit the file `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/bigbluebutton.list` so it contains the following line:

~~~
deb https://ubuntu.bigbluebutton.org/xenial-200/ bigbluebutton-xenial main
~~~

Notice the repository URL has changed from `xenial-110` to `xenial-200`.  You need only do the above step once on a server.  Proceed with the steps in the next section.

### Upgrade to latest build of BigBlueButtton 2.0

To install the latest build of BigBlueButton 2.0, enter the following commands:

~~~
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get autoremove
~~~

Finally, to ensure that all the BigBlueButton configuration files are properly updated with the correct hostname/IP address of your server, enter the following commands and substitute `<IP_or_hostname>` with the IP address or hostname of your BigBlueButton server (use whichever the server had previously been configured for).

~~~
sudo bbb-conf --setip <IP_or_hostname>
sudo bbb-conf --check
~~~
