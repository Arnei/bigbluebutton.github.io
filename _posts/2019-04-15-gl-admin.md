# Administrator Panel

## Creating an Administrator Account

To create an Administrator account with the default values, in the Greenlight directory, run the following commands:
```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/db/production:/usr/src/app/db/production --env-file .env bigbluebutton/greenlight:v2 bundle exec rake admin:create
```

If you would like to configure the name, email, or password of the Administrator account, replace the previous command with this: 
```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/db/production:/usr/src/app/db/production --env-file .env bigbluebutton/greenlight:v2 bundle exec rake admin:create["name","email","password"]
```

**Note:** All of the above arguments are optional and if you don’t specify an argument it will be replaced with a default value.

Once the command has finished it will print the account’s email and password.

**Promoting Accounts**

To promote an account from a User to an Administrator, select Promote to Admin from the Account Dropdown.

**Demoting Accounts**

To demote an account from an Administrator to a User, select Demote to User from the Account Dropdown.

While this removes the account from Greenlight the user will still be able to sign up to Greenlight using the same email in the future.

This will remove the account from Greenlight and will also prevent the user from signing up using the same email to Greenlight in the future.

To edit an account, select Edit for the specified user. This will open the edit user view.

From the edit user view, Administrators are able to edit the name, email, default language, and profile picture for the given account.
