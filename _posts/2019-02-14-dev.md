Welcome to the BigBlueButton Developer's Guide for BigBlueButton 2.2.

This document gives you an overview of how to setup a development environment for BigBlueButton 2.2-beta (referred hereafter as BigBlueButton 2.2).

# Before you begin

You first need to setup a BigBlueButton 2.2 server.  See the instructions at [Install BigBlueButton 2.2](/2.2/install.html).

# Overview

A BigBlueButton server is built from a number of components that correspond to Ubuntu packages.  Some of these components are

* bbb-web -- Implements the BigBlueButton API and conversion of documents for presentation
* akka-bbb-apps -- Server side application that handles the state of meetings on the server
* html5-client -- Meteor application leveraging MongoDB and React.js
* bbb-client -- Flash based client that loads within the browser
* bbb-apps -- Server side application for sending and receiving messages with the Flash client
* bbb-screenshare -- Screen sharing server

You don't need to understand everything about each component, but you do need to understand the [overall architecture](/overview/architecture.html) and how the components work together.

This document describes how to setup a development environment using an existing BigBlueButton 2.2 server.  Once the environment is setup, you will be able to make custom changes to BigBlueButton source, compile the source, and replace the corresponding components on the server (such as updating the BigBlueButton client).

The instructions in this guide are step-by-step so you can understand each step needed to modify a component.  If you encounter problems or errors at any section, don't ignore the errors.  Stop and double-check that you have done the step correctly.  If you are unable to determine the cause of the error, do the following

* First, use Google to search for the error.  There is a wealth of information in [bigbluebutton-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/bigbluebutton-dev) that has been indexed by Google.
* Try doing the same steps on a different BigBlueButton server.
* Post a question to bigbluebutton-dev with a description of the problem and the steps to reproduce. Post logs and error messages to [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com) link them in your post.

## Before you begin

This section makes sure you are ready to setup a BigBlueButton development environment.

### You Have a Working BigBlueButton Server

Before you can start developing on BigBlueButton, you must install BigBlueButton 2.2 (see [installation steps](/2.2/install.html)) and ensure it's working correctly. Make sure there were no errors during the installation and that you can join a session successfully.

We emphasize that your BigBlueButton server must be working **before** you start setting up the development environment.  Be sure that you can login, start sessions, join the audio bridge, share your webcam, and record and playback sessions -- all using the built-in API demos.

By starting with a working BigBlueButton server, you have the ability to switch back-and-forth between the default-packaged components and any modifications you make.

For example, suppose you modify the BigBlueButton client and something isn't working (such as the client is not fully loading), you can easily switch back to the default-packaged client and check that it's working correctly (thus ruling out any environment issues that may also be preventing your modified client from loading).

**Another Note:** These instructions assume you have the `bbb-demo` package installed so you can run any of the API demos to test your setup.

### Developing on Windows

To develop BigBlueButton from within Windows, use VMWare Player or VirtualBox to create first an Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit virtual machine (VM).  The associated documentation for VMWare Player and VirtualBox will guide you on setting up a new 16.04 64-bit VM.

When setting up the VM, it does not matter to BigBlueButton if you setup Ubuntu 16.04 server or desktop.  If you install desktop, you'll have the option of using a graphical interface to edit files.  When running the VM, you will need a host operating system capable of running a [64-bit virtual machine](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/56124/can-i-run-a-64-bit-vmware-image-on-a-32-bit-machine).

### Root Privileges

**Important:** Make sure you create another user such as "ubuntu" to avoid running into permission errors such as Nginx 403 Forbidden error or [error-null-while-compiling-resource-bundles-under-linux-with-hudson](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3863066/error-null-while-compiling-resource-bundles-under-linux-with-hudson).

Do not run commands as the root user and only use sudo when instructed to.

These instructions are written for an account called "ubuntu", but they will apply to any account that has the permissions to execute commands as root, such as

```
sudo ls
```

### wget

You'll need to download some files throughout these instructions using wget. If it's not installed on your server, you can install the package using the following command

```
sudo apt-get install wget
```

### Have a GitHub Account

The BigBlueButton [source is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton).  You need a GitHub account.  In addition, you need to be very familiar with how git works.  Specifically, you need to know how to

* clone a repository
* create a branch
* push changes back to a repository

If you have not used git before, or if the terms **_clone_**, **_branch_**, and **_commit_** are unfamiliar to you, stop now.  These are fundamental concepts to git that you need to become competent with before trying to develop on BigBlueButton. To become competent, a good place to start is this [free book](http://git-scm.com/book) and [GitHub Help pages](http://help.github.com/).

Using GitHub makes it easy for you to work on your own copy of the BigBlueButton source, store your updates to the source to your GitHub account, and make it easy for you to [contribute to BigBlueButton](/support/faq.html#contributing-to-bigbluebutton).

### Subscribe to bigbluebutton-dev

We recommend you subscribe to the [bigbluebutton-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/topics?gvc=2) mailing list to follow updates to the development of BigBlueButton and to collaborate with other developers.

# Setup a Development Environment

First, you need to install the core development tools.

```
sudo apt-get install git-core ant ant-contrib openjdk-8-jdk-headless
```

With the JDK installed, you need to set the JAVA_HOME variable. Edit `~/.profile` (here we are using vim to edit the file)

```
vi ~/.profile
```

Add the following line at the end of the file

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
```

Reload your profile (this will happen automatically when you next login, but we'll do it explicitly here to load the new environment variable).

```
source ~/.profile
```

Do a quick test to ensure JAVA_HOME is set.

```
$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
```

In the next step, you need to install a number of tools using sdkman.

```
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"

sdk install gradle 5.5.1
sdk install grails 3.3.9
sdk install sbt 1.2.8
sdk install maven 3.5.0
```

## Legacy Tools

Instructions for downloading the Flash SDK can be found [here](/2.2-legacy-dev/).

## Checking out the Source

With the development tools installed, we'll next clone the source in the following directory:

```
/home/ubuntu/dev
```

Using your GitHub account, do the following

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the BigBlueButton repository into your GitHub account
2. Clone your repository into your `~/dev` folder

After cloning, you'll have the following directory (make sure the `bigbluebutton` directory is within your `dev` directory).

```
/home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton
```

Confirm that you are working on the master branch.

```
cd /home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton
git status
```

You should see

```
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

When you first clone the BigBlueButton git repository, git will place you, by default, on the `master` branch, which is the latest code for BigBlueButton.  At this point the `master` branch is fine for BBB 2.2 development, but in the future there will be a release branch for 2.2 likely named `v2.2.x-release`.

The first thing we need to do is to add the remote repository to our local clone.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton.git
```

You can now check your local list of tracked repositories to verify that the addition worked. You should see at least two results (origin and upstream). The one named "origin" should link to your personal fork and is the repository that you cloned. The second result "upstream" should link to the main BigBlueButton repository.

```
git remote -v
```

After, we need to fetch the most up to date version of the remote repository.

```
git fetch upstream
```

You are now ready to create a new branch to start your work and base the new branch off master.

```
git checkout -b my-changes-branch upstream/master
```

"checkout" switches branches

"-b" is an option to create a new branch before switching

"my-changes-branch" will be the name of the new branch

"upstream/master" is where you want to start your new branch

You should now confirm that you are in the correct branch.

```
git status

# On branch my-changes-branch
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

# Production Environment

Okay. Let's pause for a minute. 

You have set-up the necessary tools and cloned the source, but if you are going to start making changes to BigBlueButton code you need to understand how the parts interact. 

Below is an overview of the different components in a production set-up. When developing you want to change your configuration settings to load new changes instead of the ones deployed for production.

![production](/images/10/prod-env.png)

As you can see, nginx is configured to load the client from `/var/www/bigbluebutton/client` directory and forward calls to web-api on tomcat7. During development, you need to tell nginx to load from your development directory (`/home/ubuntu/dev/bigbluebutton`)

After going through the steps below, you will end up with the following setup.

![development](/images/10/dev-env.png)

The components that run in Red5 don't change when you deploy the development files for bbb-apps, bbb-voice, bbb-video, and bbb-deskshare into `/usr/share/red5`. However, notice that the client and web-api are served from  different places.

# Developing the HTML5 client

```
$ cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html5
```

There is one change required to settings.yml to get webcam and screenshare working in the client (assuming you're using HTTPS already). The first step is to find the value for `kurento.wsUrl` packaged settings.yml.

```
grep "wsUrl" /usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings.yml
```

Next, edit the development settings.yml and change `wsUrl` to match what was retrieved before.

```
vi private/config/settings.yml
```

You're now ready to run the HTML5 code. First shut down the packaged version of the HTML5 client so you are not running two copies in parallel.

```
$ sudo systemctl stop bbb-html5
```

Install the npm dependencies.

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Finally, run the HTML5 code.

```
$ npm start
```

By default, the client will run in `development` mode. Loading into production environment can be done by passing the value of `NODE_ENV`:

```
$ NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

## HTML5 Coding Practices

For coding conventions related to the HTML5 code refer to [this document](/html5-best-practices.html).

## /private/config

All configurations are located in **/private/config/settings.yml**. If you make any changes to the YAML configuration you will need to restart the meteor process.

During Meteor.startup() the configuration file is loaded and can be accessed through the Meteor.settings.public object.

# Build bbb-common-message

The bbb-common-message is required by a few components of BigBlueButton. So it is required to build this
first. Otherwise, you will run into compile errors.

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-message
./deploy.sh
```

# Developing BBB-Web

First, we need to update the latest bigbluebutton.properties file according to your setup. Basically, you will have to change the URL and security salt. If you don't know your salt, run `sudo bbb-conf --salt`

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/

# Edit the file and change the values of bigbluebutton.web.serverURL and securitySalt. 
vi bigbluebutton-web/grails-app/conf/bigbluebutton.properties
```

Now you need to give your user account access to upload slides to the presentation directory and also access to write log files.

```
sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx /var/bigbluebutton
sudo chmod -R ugo+rwx /var/log/bigbluebutton
```

Now you need to create the nginx file that will redirect calls to your development bbb-web.

```
echo "
# Handle request to bbb-web running within Tomcat. This is for
# the BBB-API and Presentation.
location /bigbluebutton {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8989;
    proxy_redirect default;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;

    # Allow 30M uploaded presentation document.
    client_max_body_size 30m;
    client_body_buffer_size 128k;

    proxy_connect_timeout 90;
    proxy_send_timeout 90;
    proxy_read_timeout 90;

    proxy_buffer_size 4k;
    proxy_buffers 4 32k;
    proxy_busy_buffers_size 64k;
    proxy_temp_file_write_size 64k;

    include fastcgi_params;
}
" | sudo tee /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web_dev > /dev/null 2>&1
```

Now we just need to create a link to make sure that the requests are redirected properly then restart nginx.

```
sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web_dev /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web.nginx
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

Open the file `~/.sbt/0.13/global.sbt` using your editor

```
mkdir -p ~/.sbt/1.0
vi ~/.sbt/1.0/global.sbt
```

Add the following into it

```
resolvers += "Artima Maven Repository" at "http://repo.artima.com/releases"
updateOptions := updateOptions.value.withCachedResolution(true)
```

Build bbb-common-web

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-common-web
./deploy.sh
```

Now let's start grails webapp.

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-web/
```

Download the necessary libraries.

```
./build.sh
```

Start grails and tell to listen on port 8989

```
./run.sh
```

or

```
grails -reloading -Dserver.port=8989 run-app
```

If you get an error `Could not resolve placeholder 'apiVersion'`, just run `grails -Dserver.port=8989 run-war` again. The error is grails not picking up the "bigbluebutton.properties" the first time.

Now test again if you can join the demo meeting.

The command above will run a development version of bbb-web, but if you want to deploy your custom-built bbb-web you need to package a war file.

**TODO: Instructions for deploying 2.2 bbb-web**

If you changed the linking of web.nginx as instructed above you will need to also revert that back to the packaged location for bbb-web.

```
sudo ln -s -f /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web /etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/web.nginx
systemctl restart nginx
```

# Developing Akka-Apps

You can manually run the application.

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/akka-bbb-apps
./run
```

# Developing Akka-FSESL

You need to build the FS ESL library

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/bbb-fsesl-client
./deploy.sh
```

Then you can run the application.

```
cd ~/dev/bigbluebutton/akka-bbb-fsesl
./run.sh
```

# Legacy Flash applications

For instructions for building the legacy applications related to the Flash client and red5 see [this document](/legacy-dev/).

# Troubleshooting

## Welcome to Nginx page

If you get the "Welcome to Nginx" page. Check if bigbluebutton is enabled in nginx. You should see **bigbluebutton** in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`.

If not, enable it.

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/bigbluebutton /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/bigbluebutton

sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
```

## Pausing/Restarting VM gives wrong date in commit

If you are developing using a VM and you've paused the VM and later restart it, the time on the VM will be incorrect. The incorrect time will affect any commits you do in GitHub.

To ensure your VM has the correct time, you can install ntp with

```
sudo apt-get install ntp
sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart
```

and then do the following after starting the VM from a paused state

```
sudo /etc/init.d/ntp restart
```

The above will re-sync your clock.

# Setup Samba

To setup Samba

```
sudo apt-get install -y --force-yes samba
```

Then setup your shared directory by editing `/etc/samba/smb.conf`

```
; BigBlueButton: Share the development directory
[ubuntu]
   comment = BigBlueButton Development share
   path = /home/ubuntu
   browseable = yes
   read only = no
   create mask = 0755
   directory mask = 0775
   guest ok = yes
   force user = ubuntu
```
