## Overview

This document outlines the desing for the inclusion of polling in the next release of BigBlueButton.

Our goal is that polling should be quick and easy for the instructor to solicit responses from students.

The design below reflects our desire to make it easy for instructors to ask the students some pre-defined polls and, with minial effort, create new questions.

### Initiate a Poll

The polling button will appear to the right of the upload presentation button.  Polling will be an function of the presenter.

Notice there are some pre-defined polls.

### Previewing the polling question

Once the presenter has choosen a pre-defined question, BigBlueButton will present a preview of how the question will look to others.

If the preview looks good, the presenter can click 'Start Poll' to make it visible to users for response.

The presenter can click 'Edit' to modify the poll.  Notice the editing is a single text field: the first line holds the question for the poll and subsequent lines hold the answers (multiple newlines ignored).

The presenter can enable multiple responses to the poll.

If the presenter choose 'Create Poll' instead of a predefined poll, they would see the dialog for entering a poll.  They could have a list of questions for cut-and-paste.

### The User's response
When an presenter publishes the poll, all other users immediately see the poll question.

They can respond (or not) to the poll.

### Presenter views the responses
As users respond to the poll, the presenter sees the updates in real-time in the poll response window.

![View Live Responses](/images/poll-response.png)

The window graphs the responses to each question (count and percentages) along with the number of users responding to the poll.

The presenter can closes the dialog, which causes all open polling dialogs on user's clients to close.

The presenter can also click 'Publish' to publish the poll as a presentation.

### Presenter publishes the responses
If the presenter clicks 'Publish', the poll results will be converted into a single page PDF (using LibreOffice) and published as a presentation.  

![Publish the Results](/images/poll-view.png)

As with any other presentation, the presenter can then annotate the presentation with whiteboard marks when discussing the results with students.

There will be a button on the iterface to let the presenter quickly go back to the last point in their previous presentation.
