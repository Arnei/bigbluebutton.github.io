## Overview

Polling should be quick and easy for the instructor to solicit responses from students.  The draft design below reflects our desire to make it easy for the instructor to ask the students some pre-defined polls and, with minial effort, create new questions.

### Launching a poll

Polling will be a function of the presenter's roll.  When a user is presenter, they have control over the slides and will have an additional control to initiate a poll.
