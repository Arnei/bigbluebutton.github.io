# BigBlueButton in Docker

This document describes how to run BigBlueButton 2.0-beta (or later) using Docker.  

The goal of creating a docker container for BigBlueButton was make it easy for anyone running docker to run BigBlueButton.

In contrast, we were not trying to create a production version of BigBlueButton that runs under docker.  If you look at the Docker file for BigBlueButton, you'll see it runs everything within a single container.  This is clearly not the "docker way".

But for anyone with an operating system capable of running Docker, such as Mac OS X or Windows 10, they can now run a full BigBlueButton server with a single `docker run` command.  Cool.

Creating a docker image for BigBlueButton makes it very easy for any install, test, and try out BigBlueButton.  Maybe your a WordPress developer or Moodle developer and want to try out BigBlueButton on your Max OS 10 computer.  Now that's easy to do.  Maybe your a developer wanting to understand how BigBlueButton works.  Now you can run a server, SSH into it, see how it works, make changes (and maybe even break a few things to understand more), and then wipe the slate clean and start again.

Another design goal was to open just enough permissions to run BigBlueButton within docker -- no more, no less.  In other words, we wanted BigBlueButton running within docker to be isolated from the host computer and minimized resource conflicts.

As a result, running BigBlueButton in Docker has the following limitations: 

  * Nginx does not have a SSL certificate, so you'll need to use FireFox to use WebRTC audio
  * Due to the overhead of mapping ports from the host to the container's network, the default UDP port range for WebRTC is 38 ports (but this is configurable)
  * Processes are started using `supervisord` (instead of `systemd`)

You can find the [bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton](https://hub.docker.com/r/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/) Docker image on Docker hub.

# Installing Docker

First, if you have not already done so, you need to install Docker on your computer. For instructions, see [the Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).

# Running BigBlueButton in Docker

You have two options for running BigBlueButton in Docker. You can either pull the image from Docker hub or build the Docker image from source.

## Build the Docker Image

It is recommended that you pull the latest image from Docker hub, but if you want to build the image yourself from source you should follow these steps. Otherwise, skip this section.

You will need to clone the source from Github. You can find the repository on Github at [bigbluebutton/docker](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/docker).

~~~
git clone https://github.com/bigbluebutton/docker
~~~

If you have a local `apt-get` caching server (such as using `apt-cacher-ng`), then edit the Docker file, uncomment the following line and change 192.168.0.130 to match the hostname/IP address of your proxy server.

~~~
# RUN echo 'Acquire::http::Proxy "http://192.168.0.130:3142";'  > /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01proxy
~~~

Doing this will speed up repeated builds of the Docker container.

To build the docker image, switch into the repo and execute the following command:

~~~
docker build -t bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton .
~~~

After Docker has finished building the BigBlueButton image, you can check it using the `docker images` command.

~~~
$ docker images
REPOSITORY                TAG      IMAGE ID         CREATED             SIZE
bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton      latest   ca5ab0317d11     18 hours ago        3.11 GB
~~~

## Run BigBlueButton in Docker

BigBlueButton needs to know the IP address of the host running the conrtainer so it can listen for incoming connections.  However, this IP address isn't available to applications running within a container. Therefore, to run BigBlueButton witin a Docker container, you need to pass the IP address of your computer via the parameter `-h <HOSTIP>`.  Here we are running BigBlueButton on the host with IP address `192.168.0.130`.

~~~
docker run -p 80:80/tcp -p 1935:1935/tcp -p 5066:5066/tcp -p 32730-32768:32730-32768/udp -p 2202:2202 --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name bigbluebutton bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton -h 192.168.0.130
~~~

If you didn't already build the image, this may take a while to pull the image.

The parameter `--cap-add=NET_ADMIN` gives the `startup.sh` script the ability to setup a dummy network interface card (NIC) to enable FreeSWITCH to bind to the host's IP address for receiving the RTP stream for a WebRTC audio connection.  

A few more words on `startup.sh` -- this script makes all the necessary modifications to BigBlueButton's configuration files before running `supervisord` (which starts up all the BigBlueButton components).  

BigBlueButton takes about 10 seconds to startup.  After that, you can login with FireFox using `http://<HOSTIP>` and launch BigBlueButton.

The Docker image installs the package `bbb-demo` so all the API demos are available.  You can access the HTML5 client with the `http://<HOSTIP>/demo/demoHTML5.jsp`.  Here's the HTML5 client running within the docker container.

# Administration

## Login to the container

You can directly login to the running container. To login to the container, execute the command

~~~
$ docker exec -it bigbluebutton /bin/bash
root@4dd41ad9bba0:/# 
~~~

Yay, we now have a full BigBlueButton server at our command.  Let's see what `bbb-conf --check` says.

Here you can see the internal IP address of the docker container is 172.17.0.2 whereas the IP address of the host is 192.168.0.130.  There is a warning about a missmatch, but that's because Docker assigns each container it's own IP address.

You can now view BigBlueButton's log files and restart BigBlueButton (see next section).  On some systems, we noticed that the aboe 

## Restart BigBlueButton

The Ubuntu 16.04 image for Docker does not provide `systemd`.  To start all the individual BigBlueButton components that would normally be run with `systemd`, the docker container uses [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/).

To see the status of all the processes, login to the Docker container (see previous section) and enter the command
`supervisorctl status`.

~~~
/# supervisorctl status
bbb-apps-akka                    RUNNING   pid 144, uptime 0:01:57
bbb-fsesl-akka                   RUNNING   pid 139, uptime 0:01:57
bbb-html5                        RUNNING   pid 151, uptime 0:01:57
freeswitch                       RUNNING   pid 147, uptime 0:01:57
mongod                           RUNNING   pid 136, uptime 0:01:57
nginx                            RUNNING   pid 143, uptime 0:01:57

rap-publish-worker               RUNNING   pid 1649, uptime 0:00:14
rap-sanity-worker                RUNNING   pid 1655, uptime 0:00:10

redis-server                     EXITED    Oct 24 11:48 PM
tomcat7                          RUNNING   pid 135, uptime 0:01:57
~~~

Yo may see record and playback scripts showing `EXITED.  This is the expected behaviour (they automatically quit after 30 seconds if there is no recording to process) an  `supervisord` will simply run them again.

You can restart BigBlueButton using the command `supervisorctl restart all`

~~~
# supervisorctl restart all
nginx: stopped
libreoffice: stopped
bbb-apps-akka: stopped
bbb-fsesl-akka: stopped
tomcat7: stopped
red5: stopped
freeswitch: stopped
red5: started
bbb-fsesl-akka: started
tomcat7: started
nginx: started
bbb-apps-akka: started
freeswitch: started
redis-server: started
libreoffice: started
bbb-rap-publish-worker: ERROR (spawn error)
rap-sanity-worker: ERROR (spawn error)
rap-process-worker: ERROR (spawn error)
rap-archive-worker: ERROR (spawn error)
~~~

Again, you can ignore the `(spawn error)` for the record and playback scripts as they exit if there is not recording to process.

### Stopping to docker container

When you are finished with running BigBlueButton in docker, get the name of the container with `docker ps`.  For example, if this command returns the name of the container as `vibrant_shockley`, then you can stop the container with the command

~~~
# docker stop bigbluebutton
~~~

## Troubleshooting

### Windows 10 Pro automatically binds to port 80 

We not yet figured out how to run BigBlueButton on Windows 10 pro as Windows seems to already have an application binding to port 80.
