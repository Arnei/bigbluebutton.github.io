# Overview

This document describes the BigBlueButton API available for integration with 3rd-party applications.  

The API is implemented with developer in mind. To make and API call a BigBlueButton, your 3rd-party application makes HTTP requests to a URL.  All API calls include a checksum that signs the parameters with a shared secret (called salt by BigBlueButton).

The BigBlueButton server returns an XML response to all API calls.

The API implementation bigbluebutton-web component, which has been written using the Grails framework.

## Updates to API in BigBlueButton 0.9.0

Updated API calls in 0.9.0:

  * **join** - `configToken` can now reference a file in `/var/bigbluebutton/configs`
  * **create** - Added three parameters: `moderatorOnlyMessage` to display message only visible to moderators and `autoStartRecording`/`allowStartStopRecording` to provide finer control over recordings.


# API Security Model
The BigBlueButton API security model enabled 3rd-party applications to make API calls (if they have the shared secret), but not allow other people (end users) to make API calls.

The BigBlueButton API calls are almost all made server-to-server.  If you installed the package bbb-demo you get a set of API examples, written in Java Server Pages (JSP) that demonstrate how to use the BigBlueButton API.  These demos run as a web application in tomcat7.  The web application makes HTTP requests to the BigBlueButton server's API end point. 

You can retrieve the API parameters (API endpoint and shared secret) using the command

```
bbb-conf --secret
```

Here's a sample return

```
       URL: http://test-install.blindsidenetworks.com/bigbluebutton/
    Secret: 8cd8ef52e8e101574e400365b55e11a6
```

You should *not* embed the shared secret witin a web page and make BigBlueButton API calls within JavaScript running within a browser.  An end user will be able to see the shared secret within in their browser (the built-in debugging tools would make this secret easily accessibile).  Once someone has the shared secret for your BigBlueButton server, they could create their own API calls.  If the shared secret stays on the server components of your application, then it's never visible to end-users.


## Configuration

The shared secret is set in

```
   /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.properties 
```

Look for the parameter (it's called securitySalt due to legacy naming of the string)

```
   securitySalt=<your_salt>
```

When you install BigBlueButton, the packaging scripts create a random 32 character shared secret.  You can also change the secret at anytime using the command `bbb-conf`.

```
   bbb-conf --setsecret <new_shared_secret>
```


**IMPORTANT: DO NOT ALLOW END USERS TO KNOW YOUR SHARED SECRET OR ELSE YOUR SECURITY WILL BE COMPROMISED.**

## Usage

The implementation of this security model lies in ApiController.groovy.  It entails creating a checksum out of the combination of the entire HTTP query string and a server-configured security token.

To use the security model, you must be able to create an SHA-1 checksum out of the call name *plus* the query string *plus* the shared secret that you configured on your server. To do so, follow these steps:

  1. Create the entire query string for your API call without the checksum parameter.
    * Example for create meeting API call: `name=Test+Meeting&meetingID=abc123&attendeePW=111222&moderatorPW=333444`
  1. Prepend the API call name to your string
    * Example for above query string:
      * API call name is `create`
      * String becomes: `createname=Test+Meeting&meetingID=abc123&attendeePW=111222&moderatorPW=333444`
  1. Now, append the shared secret to your string
    * Example for above query string:
      * shared secret is `639259d4-9dd8-4b25-bf01-95f9567eaf4b`
      * String becomes: `createname=Test+Meeting&meetingID=abc123&attendeePW=111222&moderatorPW=333444639259d4-9dd8-4b25-bf01-95f9567eaf4b`
  1. Now, find the SHA-1 sum for that string (implementation varies based on programming language).
    * the SHA-1 sum for the above string is: `1fcbb0c4fc1f039f73aa6d697d2db9ba7f803f17`
  1. Add a checksum parameter to your query string that contains this checksum.
    * Above example becomes: `name=Test+Meeting&meetingID=abc123&attendeePW=111222&moderatorPW=333444&checksum=1fcbb0c4fc1f039f73aa6d697d2db9ba7f803f17`

You **MUST** send this checksum with **EVERY** API call. Since end users do not know your shared secret, they can not fake calls to the server, and they can not modify any API calls since changing a single parameter name or value by only one character will completely change the checksum required to validate the call.

Implementations of the SHA-1 functionality exist in nearly all programming languages. Here are example methods or links to example implementations for various languages:

  * [JavaScript](http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/)
    * describes MD5 also
  * [Java](http://commons.apache.org/codec/) 
    * You can use `org.apache.commons.codec.digest.DigestUtils` and call `DigestUtils.shaHex(string + salt)`
  * [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/function.sha1.php)
    * simply call `sha(string + salt)`


## Error handling

All API calls make a best-effort attempt to return a properly formatted document that contains enough information for the user to be able to determine what the error is.

Errors are returned with a `returncode` value of `FAILED` and a `message` and `messageKey` value.  We will try very hard to keep the messageKey stable (unchanging) throughout the life of the API.  However, the `message` value is a plain text (English) value that may change with time.

You can use the messageKey to determine the type of error and look up internationalized text within your own system if needed.  For example, an invalid request may return an error message of "No conference with that meeting ID exists", but the messageKey is simple "invalidMeetingIdentifier".

# API Calls

The following response parameters are standard to every call and may be returned from any call.

**Parameters:**

| **Param Name**  | **Required / Optional** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:----------------|:------------------------|:---------|:----------------|
| checksum        | Varies                  | String   | See the **Security** section for more details on the usage for this parameter. </p> <p>This is basically a SHA-1 hash of callName + queryString + securitySalt. The security salt will be configured into the application at deploy time. All calls to the API must include the checksum parameter. |

**Response:**

| **Param Name**   | **When Returned** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:-----------------|:------------------|:---------|:----------------|
| returncode       | Always            | String   | <p>Indicates whether the intended function was successful or not.</p> Always one of two values: <ul><li>FAILED – there was an error of some sort – look for the message and messageKey for more information. Note that if the `returncode` is FAILED, the call-specific response parameters marked as “always returned” will not be returned. They are only returned as part of successful responses.</li> <li>SUCCESS – the call succeeded – the other parameters that are normally associated with this call will be returned.</li</ul>|
| message          | Sometimes         | String   | A message that gives additional information about the status of the call. A message parameter will always be returned if the returncode was FAILED. A message may also be returned in some cases where returncode was SUCCESS if additional information would be helpful. |
| messageKey       | Sometimes         | String   | Provides similar functionality to the message and follows the same rules. However, a message key will be much shorter and will generally remain the same for the life of the API whereas a message may change over time. If your third party application would like to internationalize or otherwise change the standard messages returned, you can look up your own custom messages based on this messageKey. |


## create

Creates a BigBlueButton meeting.  

The create call is idempotent: you can call it multiple times with the same parameters without side effects.  This simplifies the logic for joining a user into a session, your application can always call create before returning the join URL. This way, regardless of the order in which users join, the meeting will always exist but won't be empty.  The BigBlueButton server will automatically remove empty meetings that were created but have never had any users after a number of minutes specified by `defaultMeetingCreateJoinDuration`defined in `bigbluebutton.properties`. 

**Resource URL:**

http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/create?[parameters]&checksum=[checksum]

**Parameters:**

| **Param Name** | **Required / Optional** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---------------|:------------------------|:---------|:----------------| 
| name           | Optional                | String   | A name for the meeting. |
| meetingID      | Required                | String   | A meeting ID that can be used to identify this meeting by the 3rd-party application.  This must be unique to the server that you are calling: different active meetings can not have the same meeting ID.  If you supply a non-unique meeting ID (a meeting is already in progress with the same meeting ID), then if the other parameters in the create call are identical, the create call will succeed (but will receive a warning message in the response).  The create call is idempotent: calling multiple times does not have any side effect.  This enables a 3rd-party applications to avoid checking if the meeting is running and always call create before joining each user.  Meeting IDs should only contain upper/lower ASCII letters, numbers, dashes, or underscores.  A good choice for the meeting ID is to generate a [GUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globally_unique_identifier) value, this all but guarantees that different meetings will not have the same meetingID. |
| attendeePW     | Required                | String    | The password that will be required for attendees to join the meeting. This is optional, and if not supplied, BBB will assign a random password. |
| moderatorPW    | Required                | String    | The password that will be required for moderators to join the meeting or for certain administrative actions (i.e. ending a meeting). This is optional, and if not supplied, BBB will assign a random password. |
| welcome        | Optional                | String    | A welcome message that gets displayed on the chat window when the participant joins. You can include keywords (<code>%%CONFNAME%%</code>, <code>%%DIALNUM%%</code>, <code>%%CONFNUM%%</code>) which will be substituted automatically. You can set a default welcome message on [bigbluebutton.properties][bigbluebutton.properties] |
| dialNumber     | Optional                | String    | The dial access number that participants can call in using regular phone. You can set a default dial number on [bigbluebutton.properties][bigbluebutton.properties] | 
| voiceBridge    | Optional                | String    | Voice conference number that participants enter to join the voice conference. The default pattern for this is a 5-digit number. This is the PIN that a dial-in user must enter to join the conference.  If you want to change this pattern, you have to edit FreeSWITCH dialplan and `defaultNumDigitsForTelVoice` of [bigbluebutton.properties][bigbluebutton.properties].  When using the default setup, we recommend you always pass a 5-digit voiceBridge parameter. Finally, if you don't pass a value for voiceBridge, then users will not be able to join a voice conference for the session. (see FAQ entry [Users do not appear in listeners window](/support/faq.html#users-do-not-appear-in-the-listeners-window). |
| webVoice       | Optional                | String    | Voice conference alphanumberic that participants enter to join the voice conference. |
| logoutURL      | Optional                | String    | The URL that the BigBlueButton client will go to after users click the OK button on the 'You have been logged out message'.  This overrides, the value for <code>bigbluebutton.web.loggedOutURL</code> if defined in [bigbluebutton.properties][bigbluebutton.properties] |
| record         | Optional                | String    | Setting ‘record=true’ instructs the BigBlueButton server to record the media and events in the session for later playback. Available values are true or false. Default value is false. |
| duration       | Optional                | Number    | The maximum length (in minutes) for the meeting.  Normally, the BigBlueButton server will end the meeting when either (a) the last person leaves (it takes a minute or two for the server to clear the meeting from memory) or when the server receives an [end](#end) API request with the associated meetingID (everyone is kicked and the meeting is immediately cleared from memory).   BigBlueButton begins tracking the length of a meeting when the first person joins.  If duration contains a non-zero value, then when the length of the meeting exceeds the duration value the server will immediately end the meeting (same as receiving an end API request).  |
| meta           | Optional                | String    | You can pass one or more metadata values for create a meeting. These will be stored by BigBlueButton and later retrievable via the getMeetingInfo call and getRecordings. Examples of meta parameters are meta_Presenter, meta_category, meta_LABEL, etc.  All parameters are converted to lower case, so meta_Presenter would be the same as meta_PRESENTER. |
| moderatorOnlyMessage   | Optional        | String    | Display a message to all moderators in the public chat. |
| autoStartRecording     | Optional        | Boolean (default false) | Automatically starts recording when first user joins. NOTE: Don't set to autoStartRecording =false and allowStartStopRecording=false as the user won't be able to record. |
| allowStartStopRecording | Optional    | Boolean (default true)  | Allow the user to start/stop recording. This means the meeting can start recording automatically (autoStartRecording=true) with the user able to stop/start recording from the client. |

           <message>Meeting has been create</message> 
       </meeting> 
    </response> 

### Preupload Slides

You can now preupload slides within the create call. You can specify an URL for BigBlueButton to download and process the slides, or you can embed the slides in base64 as part of the POST request. For use the preupload slides part, you have to send a HTTP POST request (by default, the total size of the POST request can't exceed 2MB, so embedding very large slides won't work).  The URL Resource has to be the same as the previously described.

In the body part, you would append a simple XML like the example below:

    <modules> 
       <module name="presentation"> 
          <document url="http://www.samplepdf.com/sample.pdf" /> 
          <document name="sample-presentation.pdf">JVBERi0xLjQKJ....
            [clipped here]
            ....0CiUlRU9GCg==
          </document> 
       </module> 
    </modules> 

For more information about the preupload slides check the following [link](http://groups.google.com/group/bigbluebutton-dev/browse_thread/thread/d36ba6ff53e4aa79). For a complete example of the preupload slides check the following demos: [demo7](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/master/bbb-api-demo/src/main/webapp/demo7.jsp) and [demo8](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/blob/master/bbb-api-demo/src/main/webapp/demo8.jsp)


## join

Joins a user to the meeting specified in the meetingID parameter.

**Resource URL:**

http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/join?[parameters]&checksum=[checksum]

**Parameters:**

| **Param Name**    | **Required/Optional** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:------------------|:----------------------|:---------|:----------------|
| fullName          | Required              | String   | The full name that is to be used to identify this user to other conference attendees. |
| meetingID         | Required              | String   | The meeting ID that identifies the meeting you are attempting to join. |
| password          | Required              | String   | The password that this attendee is using. If the moderator password is supplied, he will be given moderator status (and the same for attendee password, etc) |
| createTime        | Optional              | String   | Third-party apps using the API can now pass createTime parameter (which was created in the create call), BigBlueButton will ensure it matches the ‘createTime’ for the session.  If they differ, BigBlueButton will not proceed with the join request. This prevents a user from reusing their join URL for a subsequent session with the same meetingID. |
| userID            | Optional              | String   | An identifier for this user that will help your application to identify which person this is.  This user ID will be returned for this user in the getMeetingInfo API call so that you can check |
| webVoiceConf      | Optional              | String   | If you want to pass in a custom voice-extension when a user joins the voice conference using voip. This is useful if you want to collect more info in you Call Detail Records about the user joining the conference. You need to modify your /etc/asterisk/bbb-extensions.conf to handle this new extensions. |
| configToken       | Optional              | String   | The token returned by a setConfigXML API call.  This causes the BigBlueButton client to load the config.xml associated with the token (not the default config.xml)  |
| avatarURL         | Optional              | String   | The link for the user's avatar to be displayed when displayAvatar in config.xml is set to true.  |
| redirect          | Optional (Experimental) | String | The default behaviour of the JOIN API is to redirect the browser to the Flash client when the JOIN call succeeds. There have been requests if it's possible to embed the Flash client in a "container" page and that the client starts as a hidden DIV tag which becomes visible on the successful JOIN. Setting this variable to FALSE will not redirect the browser but returns an XML instead whether the JOIN call has succeeded or not. The third party app is responsible for displaying the client to the user. |
| clientURL         | Optional (Experimental) | String | Some third party apps what to display their own custom client. These apps can pass the URL containing the custom client and when redirect is not set to false, the browser will get redirected to the value of clientURL |


**Example Requests:**


* http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/join?meetingID=test01&password=mp&fullName=John&checksum=1234
* http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/join?meetingID=test01&password=ap&fullName=Mark&checksum=wxyz
* http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/join?meetingID=test01&password=ap&fullName=Chris&createTime=273648&checksum=abcd

**Example Response:**

There is no XML response for this call if it is properly formatted.  You should simply redirect the user to the call URL, and they will be entered into the meeting.

## isMeetingRunning

This call enables you to simply check on whether or not a meeting is running by looking it up with your meeting ID.

**Resource URL:**

http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/isMeetingRunning?[parameters]&checksum=[checksum]

**Parameters:**

| **Param Name**        | **Required/Optional** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:----------------------|:----------------------|:---------|:----------------|
| meetingID             | Required              | String   | The meeting ID that identifies the meeting you are attempting to check on. |

**Example Requests:**

http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/isMeetingRunning?meetingID=test01&checksum=1234

**Example Response:**

    <response>
      <returncode>SUCCESS</returncode>
      <running>true</running>
    </response>

running can be “true” or “false” that signals whether a meeting with this ID is currently running.


## end

Use this to forcibly end a meeting and kick all participants out of the meeting.

**Resource URL:**

* http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/end?[parameters]&checksum=[checksum]

**Parameters:**

| **Param Name** | **Required/Optional** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---------------|:----------------------|:---------|:----------------|
| meetingID      | Required              | String   | The meeting ID that identifies the meeting you are attempting to end. |
| password       | Required              | String   | The moderator password for this meeting. You can not end a meeting using the attendee password.|

**Example Requests:**

* http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/end?meetingID=1234567890&password=mp&checksum=1234

**Example Response:**

    <response>
      <returncode>SUCCESS</returncode>
      <messageKey>sentEndMeetingRequest</messageKey>
      <message>
        A request to end the meeting was sent. Please wait a few seconds, and then use the getMeetingInfo or isMeetingRunning API calls to verify that   it was ended.
      </message>
    </response>

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You should note that when you call end meeting, it is simply sending a request to the backend (Red5) server that is handling all the conference traffic.  That backend server will immediately attempt to send every connected client a logout event, kicking them from the meeting.  It will then disconnect them, and the meeting will be ended.  However, this may take several seconds, depending on network conditions.  Therefore, the end meeting call will return a success as soon as the request is sent.  But to be sure that it completed, you should then check back a few seconds later by using the getMeetingInfo or isMeetingRunning calls to verify that all participants have left the meeting and that it successfully ended.


## getMeetingInfo

This call will return all of a meeting's information, including the list of attendees as well as start and end times.

## getDefaultConfigXML

Retrieve the default config.xml.  This call enables a 3rd party application to get the current config.xml, modify it's parameters, and use setConfigXML to store it on the BigBlueButton server (getting a reference token to the new config.xml), then using the token in as a parameter in the join URL to override the default config.xml.

**Resource URL:**

http&#58;//yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/getDefaultConfigXML?[parameters]&checksum=[checksum]

## setConfigXML

Associate a custom config.xml file with the current session. This call returns a token that can later be passed as a parameter to a join URL. When passed as a parameter, the BigBlueButton client will use the associated config.xml for the user instead of using the default config.xml. This enables 3rd party applications to provide user-specific config.xml files.

**Resource URL:**

`POST http://yourserver.com/bigbluebutton/api/setConfigXML`

**Parameters:**

| **Param Name** | **Required / Optional** | **Type** | **Description** |
|:---------------|:------------------------|:---------|:----------------|
| meetingID      | Required                | String   | A meetingID to an active meeting |
| configXML      | Required                | String   | A valid config.xml file |


**Parameter Encoding:**

This API request encodes the parameters in the body of a post request, using the content type `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (The Content-Type header must be present or the parameters will not be processed). As a result, the calculation for the checksum parameter is done differently than in other types of requests.

Similarly like for GET requests, the checksum is calculated by taking the SHA-1 hash of a string generated by concatenating the _method name_, _parameter string_, and _shared secret_. However, the _parameter string_ must be generated in a very specific format to ensure that changes in the body encoding won't invalidate the checksum.

To generate the _parameter string_ field, do the following steps:

* Sort the parameters in ASCII order by the parameter name. (Parameters with duplicate names are not permitted.)
* URL-encode the parameter values according to the following specification: The characters "`a`" through "`z`", "`A`" through "`Z`", "`0`" through "`9`", and "`.`", "`-`", "`*`", "`_`" remain the same. The space character "` `" is encoded as a plus sign "`+`". All other characters must be encoded as UTF-8, and then are converted bytewise to percent-encoding. This matches the default encoding method of [`java.net.URLEncoder`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/URLEncoder.html) and [Ruby's `URI.encode_www_form_component`](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI.html#method-c-encode_www_form_component). Other languages probably also have functions which match this specification.
* Join the parameter name and URL-encoded parameter value together with the "=" character.
* Concatenate all the parameter name/value pairs in order, separating them with the "&" character.

To verify the checksum, the BigBlueButton server will decode the parameters from the message body, then use the same algorithm as described above to calculate the checksum. As a result:


* You are not required to have parameters in the same order in the message body as they were in the encoded _parameter string_.
* The `checksum` parameter can be in any position.
* You are not required to use the same URL-encoding method in the message body as the encoded _parameter string_. For example, using `%20` instead of `+` for a space is OK.

**Example Requests:**

The config.xml is sent as part of a POST request. The body of the POST request must contain three parameters: `meetingID`, `configXML` and `checksum`. The `meetingID` is the meeting to which this config.xml will be associated to (the meeting must have been created previously), the `configXML` is the content of the config.xml file, and the `checksum` is the signature of this call, calculated as described above. An example showing how to calculate the checksum:

* Method name: `setConfigXML`
* Parameters: `meetingID=random-8228800` and `configXML=<config><modules><localeversion supressWarning="false">0.9.0</localeversion></modules></config>`
* Encoded parameter string: `configXML=%3Cconfig%3E%3Clocaleversion+suppressWarning%3D%22false%22%3E0.9.0%3C%2Flocaleversion%3E%3C%2Fmodules%3E%3C%2Fconfig%3E&meetingID=random-8228800`
* Shared secret: `aae06642a13942004fd83b3ba6e4o9s8`
* Final string: `setConfigXMLconfigXML=%3Cconfig%3E%3Clocaleversion+suppressWarning%3D%22false%22%3E0.9.0%3C%2Flocaleversion%3E%3C%2Fmodules%3E%3C%2Fconfig%3E&meetingID=random-8228800aae06642a13942004fd83b3ba6e4o9s8`
* The calculated checksum is `51db6f55ffa080f42f5727386beb66adb4e5cf81`
* The final parameter string that will be used in the message body is `checksum=51db6f55ffa080f42f5727386beb66adb4e5cf81&configXML=%3Cconfig%3E%3Clocaleversion+suppressWarning%3D%22false%22%3E0.9.0%3C%2Flocaleversion%3E%3C%2Fmodules%3E%3C%2Fconfig%3E&meetingID=random-8228800` (Note that the order of the parameters does not matter here.)

# API Sample Code

BigBlueButton provides API Sample Codes so you can integrated easily with your application. Feel free to contribute and post your implementation of the API in other language code in the bigbluebutton-dev mailing list.

## JSP

The JSP library included with the BigBlueButton API demos is the reference implementation of the BigBlueButton API.  We use this library to test and demonstrate how to use the API.  You can try out the demos on the [BigBlueButton demo server](http://demo.bigbluebutton.org/demo/demo1.jsp).  See [full source for the API demos](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/tree/master/bbb-api-demo/src/main/webapp/)


## PHP

There is an unofficial PHP library in [BigBlueButton Labs](https://github.com/bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton/tree/master/labs/bbb-api-php)

You need to enable the "allow_url_fopen" to "On" in your php.ini file so this example can work. Simply add/replace to your php.ini file:

<code>allow_url_fopen = On</code>

For more examples of using PHP, see the source for the [Moodle](https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/moodle-mod_bigbluebuttonbn) and [WordPress](https://github.com/blindsidenetworks/wordpress-plugin_bigbluebutton) integrations.

## Ruby

See the following [bigbluebutton-api-ruby](https://github.com/mconf/bigbluebutton-api-ruby) gem.

## Testing API Calls

To help you create/test valid API calls against your BigBlueButton server, use the excellent [API Mate](http://mconf.github.io/api-mate/) to interactively create API calls.  API Mate generates the checksums within the browser (no server component needed) so you can use it to test API calls againt a local BigBlueButton server.

# Desired Future Features

## Support for JSON/JSONP

* It would be very nice to optionally allow JSON responses, and to support JSONP. This might allow for simpler integrations, even within static or almost-static webpages using JavaScript as the primary integration language. It should not be assumed that all users will be running custom software on a server and be able to process XML responses, etc.<br>
* This being said, even within JavaScript there are simple ways to make the API call and process the returned XML (using jQuery and $.xml2json, for example)<br>

## Meeting event callbacks

This may actually even be called a “reverse API” - where we define an interface that the third- party application can implement to be notified of events. This would not be necessary for the first version of the API, but would be a nice feature for future enhancements. More details:

When major events happen within meetings, it would be very helpful to provide a way for third-party applications to be notified of these events. For instance, when a user joins a conference, they will presumably be joining through the third-party app. However, when they leave the conference, the app may have certain auditing that it needs to do to record their disconnect time, etc. If BBB could make some callback to the application, this would assist in such scenarios.

For example, the application may be able to register a URL that BBB would call with status updates. BBB would define an API that such an app would be required to implement at that URL.

i.e. -BBB could call:

* http&#58;//third-party-app/bbb-integ.php?event=meetingEnded&meetingID=abcd
* http&#58;//third-party-app/bbb-integ.php?event=userLeft&userID=1234
* http&#58;//third-party-app/bbb-integ.php?event=meetingEnded&meetingID=abcd

We are already announcing events such as this within BBB through Redis Pubsub to communicate between the Red5 apps where these events originate and the API. It would probably not be very difficult to register additional listeners through the Spring Integration configuration that will make these HTTP calls for us for each event.
