Welcome!  This document gives you an overview of what’s new in BigBlueButton 2.0.  

BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for online learning.

The goal of BigBlueButton is to enable remote students to have a high-quality online learning experience.  A key component of that goal is increasing the ability for instructors to engage remote students.   

# BigBlueButton 2.0

In BigBlueButton 2.0 we added three new features: 

 * Improved User Interface (easy-of-use)
 * Multi-user Whiteboard (engagement)
 * Shared Notes (engagement)

You can try out the new features on the server [https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/](https://demo.bigbluebutton.org/). The following video gives you an overview of the new features: [![BigBlueButton 2.0 Overview (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhoIZ9i-JYE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhoIZ9i-JYE "BigBlueButton 2.0 Overview").



## Improved User Interface

One measure of a successful user interface is how little effort it takes new users to master it.  

While we’ve spent years building and improving the features of BigBlueButton, we had never really done a comprehensive review of the overall design.  Until now.

In BigBlueButton 2.0 we’ve re-designed the interface with an updated skin and icon set.  The overall interface should look more coherent and consistent.  Consistency means that there is a uniform design language through that enables users to anticipate (and intuit) how functions work.

We’ve simplified the dialog boxes so they are easier to navigate.  For example, the new join audio dialog box shows two large icons for easy choice.

![audio](/images/20-audio.png)

All icons are displayed as vectors, which means they appear crisp even on the highest resolution monitors. 

For consitency, the actions for sharing audio, webcam, and desktop (when presenter) are now grouped together at the top middle of the screen.  The title is on the left, and the record button is on the right.

![buttons](/images/20-buttons.png)

We’ve simplified the layout of the Users list by removing the uneeded headers (it's pretty obvious what the icons mean).

In addition to improving the overall design, we've added a number of features that have been requested by our community.

### Enable Presentation Download

The presenter can now give students the ability to download a presentation.

When uploading a presentation, the presenter can check "enable download".

![enable-download](/images/20-enable-download.png)

If this option is checked, then when a download button will appear for all users in the Presentation area.  

![download-button](/images/20-download-button.png)

When a user clicks the download button, a dialog opens giving the user the ability to download any presentation that was enabled for download.

### Smoothing of Pen Tool

BigBlueButton will now apply a subtle smoothing of pen tool strokes.  The smoothing occurs after finishing a stroke finishes.

### Promote Viewer to Moderator

Moderators now have the ability to promote/demote any viewer to the role of moderators.  

To promote a viewer, click the gear icon to the right of a user’s name and choose “Promote”.

![user-promote](/images/20-user-promote.png)

Any moderator can later demote the user back to a viewer by choosing the “Demote” option from the gear icon. 

![user-demote](/images/20-user-demote.png)

### Download Public Chat Messages

BigBlueButton always let users copy the public chat to the clipboard by right-clicking on the Chat area and choosing “Copy All Text”.

In BigBlueButton 2.0, the Chat Options tab now gives users a button for copying public chat messages (which makes it more accessible for screen readers).

![chat-options](/images/20-chat-options.png) 

Options tab there are three new buttons: 

   1. Download the public chat as plain text
   1. Copy the public chat to the clipboard
   1. Delete public chat (moderator only)


### End Meeting on Logout

Any moderator now has the ability to end the meeting on logout.

![end-logout](/images/20-end-logout.png)

When logging out, a moderator will see three options.  Choosing "Yes and end meeting" will cause BigBlueButton to immediately end the session.  Ending the session will kick all users out, close the meeting, and begin nitiate the processing of the recording (if the meeting was set to be recorded).


### Full Screen Mode 

Users now have an additional button in the lower right-hand corner to enable full-screen mode in BigBlueButton.

![full-screen](/images/20-full-screen.png)

Clicking this button causes BigBlueButton to take over the full screen (this invokes the browser's built-in full screen capability).  

When users click the Full Screen button, the browser confirms switching BigBlueButton to full screen mode.

![full-screen-exit](/images/20-full-screen-exit.png)

Users can exit full screen by pressing the ESC key.


# Shared Notes

Active learning is more effective than passivly watching a lecture.   Engaging students to recall and apply what they just learned re-enforces new concepts and ideas.  Breakout rooms are an example of having students engage in discussion.

BigBlueButton 2.0 adds a new layout called “Shared Notes”, which gives students a collaborative note pad capturing content during the session. 

Shared notes are visible by choosing the “Shared Notes” layout.

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-layout.png)

When choosing this layout, the Shared Notes window appears on the left-hand side.  Any user can write/edit in the window at the same time.

![shared-notes-window](/images/20-shared-notes-window.png)

Note: Shared notes are not saved as part of the recording.  Think of them as a collaborative notepad during the live session.

Any moderator can clear the shared notes using the "Clear this note" option in the gear icon (this icon is only visible to moderators).

![shared-notes-clear](/images/20-shared-notes-clear.png)


## Multiple Shared Notes

A moderator can launch (up to) two additional shared notes windows. Clicking this button opens a new window called “Shared Notes 2” and “Shared Notes 3” (you can name them whatever you wish).

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-create.png)

When this option is selected, the moderator can name the new shared note winodw.

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-name.png)

The two additional windows will be visible across layouts.

## Text Formatting

The Shared Notes window allows users to apply formatting changes (font, font size, and style) to any of the text in the shared notes.

![shared-notes-format](/images/20-shared-notes-format.png)


## Download Shared Notes

Users can also download the content of the shared notes as plain text or HTML.

![shared-notes-download](/images/20-shared-notes-download.png)

The download option lets users save the shared notes for later use.  As stated above, shared notes are not saved as part of the recording - they are cleared from memory when the meeting ends.


# Multi-user Whiteboard

Another form of student engagement is getting user kinetically involved in the lecture.  This is especially true of K12 students who may have a hard time sitting and watching a lecture without involvement.  

BigBlueButton 2.0 now supports multiple users updating the whiteboard in real-time.  This enables a tutor, for example, to collaboratively work together with a student on a math problem.

To enable/disable multi-user whiteboard, the presenter clicks the Multi-User Whiteboard button on the toolbar.

![mu-button](/images/20-mu-button.png)

When engaged, all users can annotate the current slide.  The User’s names will appear to the right of their cursor.

![mu-over](/images/20-mu-over.png)

Users can only clear their own whiteboard marks (by clicking the ‘X’ button).  

If the presenter clicks the ‘X’ icon when multi-user whiteboard is turned off, BigBlueButton will clear all marks by all users.

The recording format for BigBlueButton 2.0 is updated to record and playback all multi-user whiteboard annotations.
