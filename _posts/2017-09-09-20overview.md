BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system for online learning.

The goal of the project is to enable remote students to have a high-quality online learning experience.  A key component of achieving this goal is giving the tools to engage remote students.   

This document gives you an overview of what’s new in BigBlueButton 2.0-beta (hereafter referred to as BigBlueButton 2.0).  


# BigBlueButton 2.0

We added three new features for increasing ease-of-use and user engagement: 

 * Improved User Interface (easy-of-use)
 * Multi-user Whiteboard (engagement)
 * Shared Notes (engagement)

## Improved User Interface

One measure of a successful user interface is how little effort it takes new users to master it.  

While we’ve spent years building and improving features in BigBlueButton, we had never really done a comprehensive review of the overall design.  Until now.

In BigBlueButton 2.0 we’ve re-designed the interface with an updated skin and icon set.  The overall interface should look more coherent and consistent.  Consistency means that there is a uniform design language through that enables users to anticipate (and intuit) how functions work.

![overview](/images/20-overview.png)

We’ve simplified the dialog boxes so they are easier to navigate.  For example, the new join audio dialog box shows two large icons for easy choice.

![audio](/images/20-audio.png)

All icons are now rendered from vectors; they appear crisp even on the highest resolution monitors. 

For consistency, the actions for sharing audio, webcam, and desktop (when you are the presenter) are now grouped together at the top middle of the screen.  The meeting title is on the left, and the record button is on the right.

![buttons](/images/20-buttons.png)

We’ve simplified the layout of the Users list by removing the unneeded headers (it's pretty obvious what the icons for headset and microphone mean).

![20-users](/images/20-20-users.png)

In addition to improving the overall design, we've added a number of features that have been requested by our community (outlined below).

### Enable Presentation Download

The presenter can now give students the ability to download a presentation.

When uploading a presentation, the presenter can check "Enable download of presentation".

![enable-download](/images/20-enable-download.png)

If this option is checked, a download button will appear for all users in the Presentation area.  

![download-button](/images/20-download-button.png)

Later on, when a user clicks the download button, BigBlueButton will display a dialog giving the user the ability to download any presentation that was enabled for download.

![download-dialog](/images/20-download-dialog.png)

### Smoothing of Pen Tool

BigBlueButton smooths all strokes of the pen tool.  When drawing with the pen you'll see it work as before, but when you release the mouse, BigBlueButton will smooth the lines a bit.

![smooth](/images/20-smooth.png)

This smoothing makes math equations and diagrams a bit easier to read for students.

### Promote Viewer to Moderator

Moderators now have the ability to promote/demote any viewer to the role of moderator.  To promote a viewer, click the gear icon to the right of a user’s name and choose “Promote”.

![user-promote](/images/20-user-promote.png)

Later on, any moderator can demote the same user back to a viewer by choosing the “Demote” option from the gear icon. 

![user-demote](/images/20-user-demote.png)

### Download Public Chat Messages

In previous versions BigBlueButton enabled users to copy chat to the clipboard by right-clicking anywhere on the Chat area and selecting `Copy All Text`.

In BigBlueButton 2.0, the Options tab now gives users a button for copying public chat messages to the clipboard (which makes the function more accessible for users with screen readers).  

![chat-options](/images/20-chat-options.png) 

Next to the copy button there are two others buttons

   1. Download the public chat as plain text
   1. Delete public chat (moderator only)


### End Meeting on Logout

Ever wanted to end the meeting and kick out all users.  Now, when anyone who is moderator logs out, they will have the option to immediately end the session.

![end-logout](/images/20-end-logout.png)

Selecting "Yes and end meeting" will cause BigBlueButton to immediately end the session, which in turn kicks out all other users and initiates the processing of the recording (if the meeting was set to be recorded).


### Full Screen Mode

Users can now have BigBlueButton take the entire screen with the Full Screen button.

![full-screen](/images/20-full-screen.png)

Clicking this button causes BigBlueButton to take over the full screen (this invokes the browser's built-in full screen capability).  

When users click the Full Screen button, the browser displays a confirmation dialog on the switch to full screen mode.

![full-screen-exit](/images/20-full-screen-exit.png)

Users can exit full screen mode anytime by pressing the ESC key.

### Right to left languages support

Users that are used to languages written from right to left like Arabic and Hebrew will be able to use BigBlueButton in their mother tongue. It is possible to write in those languages without any issue, however mirroring the layout from right to left remains experimental.

# Shared Notes

Active learning is more effective than passively watching a lecture.   Engaging students to recall and apply what they just learned re-enforces new concepts and ideas.  Breakout rooms are an example of having students engage in discussion.

BigBlueButton 2.0 adds a new layout called “Shared Notes”, which gives students a collaborative note pad capturing content during the session. 

Shared notes are visible by choosing the “Shared Notes” layout.

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-layout.png)

When choosing this layout, the Shared Notes window appears on the left-hand side.  Any user can write/edit in the window at the same time.

![shared-notes-window](/images/20-shared-notes-window.png)

Note: Shared notes are not saved as part of the recording.  Think of them as a collaborative notepad during the live session.

Any moderator can clear the shared notes using the "Clear this note" option in the gear icon (this icon is only visible to moderators).

![shared-notes-clear](/images/20-shared-notes-clear.png)


## Multiple Shared Notes

A moderator can launch (up to) two additional shared notes windows. Clicking this button opens a new window called “Shared Notes 2” and “Shared Notes 3” (you can name them whatever you wish).

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-create.png)

When this option is selected, the moderator can name the new shared note window.

![shared-notes-create](/images/20-shared-notes-name.png)

The two additional windows will be visible across layouts.

## Text Formatting

The Shared Notes window allows users to apply formatting changes (font, font size, and style) to any of the text in the shared notes.

![shared-notes-format](/images/20-shared-notes-format.png)


## Download Shared Notes

Users can also download the content of the shared notes as plain text or HTML.

![shared-notes-download](/images/20-shared-notes-download.png)

The download option lets users save the shared notes for later use.  As stated above, shared notes are not saved as part of the recording - they are cleared from memory when the meeting ends.


# Multi-user Whiteboard

Another form of student engagement is getting user kinetically involved in the lecture.  This is especially true of K12 students who may have a hard time sitting and watching a lecture without involvement.  

BigBlueButton 2.0 now supports multiple users updating the whiteboard in real-time.  This enables a tutor, for example, to collaboratively work together with a student on a math problem.

To enable/disable multi-user whiteboard, the presenter clicks the Multi-User Whiteboard button on the toolbar.

![mu-button](/images/20-mu-button.png)

When engaged, all users can annotate the current slide.  The User’s names will appear to the right of their cursor.

![mu-over](/images/20-mu-over.png)

Users can only clear their own whiteboard marks (by clicking the ‘X’ button).  

If the presenter clicks the ‘X’ icon when multi-user whiteboard is turned off, BigBlueButton will clear all marks by all users.

The recording format for BigBlueButton 2.0 is updated to record and playback all multi-user whiteboard annotations.



# Miscellaneous

## defaultMaxUsers

In previous versions, the value for `defaultMaxUsers` in `bigbluebutton.properites` (located in `/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/bigbluebutton/WEB-INF/classes/bigbluebutton.propreties`) was not used.  

~~~
# Default maximum number of users a meeting can have.
# Current default is 0 (meeting doesn't have a user limit).
defaultMaxUsers=0
~~~

In BigBlueButton 2.0 the server will enforce the value and, if the maximum limit is reached, redirect the user to the following URL 

~~~
   https://IP_or_HOSTNAME/?errors=[{"message":"The number of participants allowed for this meeting has been reached.","key":"maxParticipantsReached"}]
~~~

A value of `defaultMaxUsers=0` means the server will not enforce the limit.

## Refactoring of messages

In BigBlueButton 2.0 we have refactored the messaging format used to communicate between the different server components and between the client and server. The goal of this was to streamline the creation and processing of messages which in previous versions required a lot of steps. The end result is a much easier system to work with that allows for quicker edits and additions. 


## Support for (up to) 8 breakout rooms

The number of supported breakout rooms is increased from 5 to 8 rooms.
