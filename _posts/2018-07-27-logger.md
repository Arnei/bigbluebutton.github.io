## Client Logger

To use the HTML5 client logger import it and then trigger it via function call with the level name. 

~~~  
import logger from '/imports/startup/client/logger'; 

logger.warn('Hi on warn') 
~~~ 

The client logger accepts targets such as console, server and external to have logs sent to them.


Name | Default Value |Accepted Values| Description 
 --- | --- | ---| ---
target | "console" | "console", "external", "server" | Where the logs will be sent to.
level | "info"  | "debug", "info", "warn", "error" | The lowest log level that will be sent. Any log level higher than this will also be sent to the target. 
url | - | - | The end point where logs will be sent to when the target is set to "external".
method | - | "POST", "PUT" | HTTP method being used when using the target "external".

There are default values in the HTML5 configuration file `/usr/share/meteor/bundle/programs/server/assets/app/config/settings-production.json` (`bigbluebutton/bigbluebutton-html5/private/config/settings-development.json` if you are running the client from source code 

~~~
    "clientLog": {
      "server": { "enabled": true, "level": "info" },
      "console": { "enabled": false, "level": "debug" },
      "external": { "enabled": false, "level": "info", "url": "https://<YOUR_DOMAIN>/html5Log", "method": "POST" }
    }

~~~

Notice that the 'external' option is disabled by default - you can enable it on your own server after a few configuration changes.


When setting the output to external, the BigBlueButton client will POST the log events to the URL endpoint provided by uri. To create an associated endpoint, create a file  `/etc/bigbluebutton/nginx/client-log.nginx` with the following contents.

~~~
location /html5Log {
	access_log /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log postdata;
	echo_read_request_body;
}
~~~

Then create a file in /etc/nginx/conf.d/client-log.conf with the contents.

~~~
log_format postdata '$remote_addr [$time_iso8601] $request_body';
~~~

Install the full version of Nginx.

~~~
sudo apt-get install nginx-full
~~~

You may also need to create the external output file and give it the appropriate permissions and ownership:

~~~
sudo touch /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log
sudo chown www-data:adm /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log
sudo chmod 640 /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log
~~~

Finally, restart nginx with `sudo service restart nginx`. Launch the BigBlueButton client in a new session and you will see output in /var/log/nginx/html5-client.log as the client loads.

Following the logs on the server can be done via:
`tail -f html5-client.log | sed -u -e 's/\\x22/"/g' -e 's/\\x5C/ /g'`

These logs are useful for troubleshooting user's client side experience - media errors or logs, authentication and routing.
