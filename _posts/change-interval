## Change processing interval for recordings

Normally, the BigBlueButton server begins processing the data recorded in a session soon after the session finishes.  However, you can change the timing for processing by creating an override for the default `bbb-record-core.timer`.

For example, to process recordings between 18:00 to 05:59, enter

```bash
$ sudo systemctl edit bbb-record-core.timer
```

which will open a text editor.  Copy ad paste in the following contents:

```ini
[Timer]
# Disable the default timer
OnUnitInactiveSec=

# Run every minute from 18:00 to 05:59
OnCalendar=18,19,20,21,22,23,00,01,02,03,04,05:*
```

and save the file.

See the man page `systemd.time` (under CALENDAR EVENTS) for more details about the syntax for `OnCalendar=`.
